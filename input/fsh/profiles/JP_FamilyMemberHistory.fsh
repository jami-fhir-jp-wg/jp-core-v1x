* identifier ^comment = "This is a business identifier, not a resource identifier (see [discussion](resource.html#identifiers)).  It is best practice for the identifier to only appear on a single resource instance, however business practices may occasionally dictate that multiple resource instances with the same identifier can exist - possibly even with different resource types.  For example, multiple Patient and a Person resource instance might share the same social insurance number."
* identifier ^requirements = "Allows identification of the family member history as it is known by various participating systems and in a way that remains consistent across servers."
